# API for On-chain GPA ‚Äì Integration for other apps

## Project Description

The On-chain GPA system is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that provides a transparent, immutable, and verifiable way to store and manage student Grade Point Average (GPA) records. This system enables educational institutions, employers, and third-party applications to access verified academic performance data directly from the blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional transcript verification processes.

The smart contract serves as an API that allows seamless integration with various applications including job portals, scholarship platforms, university admission systems, and professional networking applications.

## Project Vision
